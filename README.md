# SkillSwap - Capstone Project

## Project Title:
**SkillSwap**

## Project Idea:

**SkillSwap** is a web application designed to connect people who what to learn new skills with others who can teach them.  This platform allowsusers to create profiles, list their skills that they want to learn. Throught a seamless interface, users can exchange their skills, making learning and teaching more accessible and collaborative.

The goal of the project is to create a user-friendly, feature-rich application that allows:

- **Skill exchange** between users
- **User authentication** for secure login/logout functionality
- **Profile management** for users to showcase their skills
- **Search functionality** to find specific skills or users 
- **Messaging system** to facilitate communication between learners and teachers

By the end of this project, the application will be ready for deployment and able to handle real-world use cases.

## Features to be Implemented:

- User Registration and Authentication (JWT)
- User Profile with Skills
- Skill Search and Browse System
- Messaging between users
- User Dashboard for managing listings and skills
- Responsive and intutitive UI/UX design
- Backend API with proper validations and error handling

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS (or Styled Compnents)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentiation:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io (for messaging)
- **Deployment:** Render (Backend), Vercel (frontend)

## Day-by-Day Plan:

### Day 1: Project Setup and Planning
- Set up the project repository and structure.
- Plan the tech stack: React for frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database.
- Outline features and finalize the initial architecture.
- Set up the development environment for both frontend and backend.

### Day 2:  Backend Setup
- Initialize the backend with Node.js and Express.
- Set up MongoDB database.
- Implement basic server structure with RESTful API endpoints.
- Create models for Users and Skills.
- Set up environment variables (eg., for database connection).

### Day 3: Authentication (JWT)
- Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Set up user registration and login endpoints.
- Test the authentication flow (registration, login, and token generation).
- Implement protected routes to secure certain endpoints.

### Day 4: User Profile and Skill Listing
- Design the user profile structure: name, skills, bio, etc.
- Implement the ability to add, edit, and remove skills, bio, etc.
- Design and create the profile page UI in React.
- Implement API endpoints to handle profile data and skill management.

### Day 5: Frontend Setup and Routing
- Set up React and React Router for page naviagation.
- Create necessary components (Home, Profile, Dashboard, etc.).
- Start building the homepage with a search bar for skills.

### Day 6: Skill Search and Browse
- Design the skill search and filter UI.
- Implement API to search for skills and filter results.
- Display search results on the forntend.
- Implement pagination if needed for search results.

### Day 7: Messaging System Implemention
- Design the messaging UI for users to communicate.
- Set up backend routes to handle messages between users.
- Implement real-time messaging (if possible, using socket.io or similar technology).
- Add message notifications to alert user about new messages.

### Day 8: Dashboard and Profile Management
- Implement the user dashboard to display owned skills and ongoing messages.
- Allow user to edit their profile, manage skills, and see activity.
- Add functionality to view other users profiles.
- Make the dashboard responsive.

### Day 9: User Testing and Bug Fixes 
- Test the application throughtly (frontend and backend).
- Fix bugs and refine the UI/UX based on feedback.
- Conduct cross-brower testing for compatibility.
- Ensure that all features are working correctly.

### Day 10: Deployment Prepration
- Set up the deployment environment (eg., Render/ Heroku for backend, Netlify/Vercel for the forntend).
- Deploy the frontend and backend.
- Test the deployed version and ensure everything works as expected.
- Ensure security best practices (eg., secure API calls, sanitizing inputs).

### Day 11: Final Refractor and Documentation
- Refactor code for clarity and performance improvements.
- Write final documentation for the codebase, including API documentation and project setup instructions.
- Write a user guide explaining how to use the platform.

### Day 12: Final Refactor and Documentation
- Conduct a final review of the project.
- Polish the README file with detailed information about the project.
- Add links to GitHub, deployed site, and related resources.
- Prepare the project for submission.

## Conclusion:
By following this structured plan, I am to build **SkillSwap** into a fully functional web application. Each step will focus on completing a core feature while maintaining clean code and effective project management.  This project will not only test my technical skills but also enhance my ability to work with a structred timeline.
